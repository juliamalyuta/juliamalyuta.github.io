        <h1> Tic-Connect6-Toe </h1>
 <p> Welcome to my Apps page! This page will have the app that I was able to create with the help of my CSC106 Class.
        </p>
        
 <p> My partner, Katana Lor, and I have teamed up to give you this amazing app. The app is a combination of Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4. But here's the twist, you actually have to connect 6! With the help of Khan's Tic-Tac-Toe game and Memeory Game we were able to create this amazing monstrosity of a game. The aim of the game is to get either six X's or six O's in a row. You can go horizontally, vertically, and. even diagnonally! Who ever gets six in a row first wins. The starting page has the title of the game, my name along with Katana's, our bitmojis, and the "Start Game" button. 
        The game has not been made yet to work with other online players.  
        </p>
     
        <p>
            This is a real test of patience and thinking ahead skills. Do you have what it takes to beat Tic-Connect6-Toe? Press the "Start Game" button to play!
